Corrientes 3135, CABA 1193, Argentina. By downloading, installing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may modify these Terms at any time. After each update, you must <strong>visit this page</strong> to review the current Terms; your continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Macro Lens AI is a nutritional-tracking application that uses AI-driven analysis of meal images and user-entered portions to estimate calories and macronutrients.</p>

    <h2>3. Eligibility &amp; Parental Consent</h2>
    <p>All services are available only for individuals aged <strong>13 years or older</strong>. If you are 13 or older but under 18 (or the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction, if higher), you <strong>must</strong> review these Terms with your parent or guardian to ensure they understand and accept them on your behalf. Parents or guardians agree to assume full responsibility (including financial charges and legal liability) for their child’s use of the App.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>All rights not expressly granted are reserved.</p>

    <h2>5. User Content</h2>
    <p>You may submit images, descriptions or other data (“User Content”). By submitting User Content, you represent and warrant that you own all rights to it or have permission to grant us a license. You grant BUSINESSMART S.A. a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicensable, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify and display your User Content <strong>solely</strong> to operate, improve and promote the App. We may, at our discretion, reject, remove or edit any User Content that violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable, without notice and without liability. You retain ownership of your User Content.</p>

    <h2>6. Subscriptions &amp; Payments</h2>
    <p>All subscriptions are managed through the <strong>Apple App Store</strong> and <strong>Google Play Store</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Auto-renewal:</strong> Subscriptions auto-renew until canceled.</li>
        <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> To avoid renewal charges, cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services &amp; Security</h2>
    <p>The App transmits images and data to third-party AI services (e.g. OpenAI) for analysis. We do <strong>not</strong> store your data on our own servers; all processing is real-time and data remains on your device unless you choose to export it. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of those third parties; you should review their policies directly.</p>

    <h2>8. Content</h2>
    <p>Although the Service has been compiled in good faith, no representation is made as to the completeness or accuracy of the information it contains.

If you access the App from another jurisdiction, you are responsible for complying with all local laws; we disclaim responsibility for compliance outside Argentina.</p>
